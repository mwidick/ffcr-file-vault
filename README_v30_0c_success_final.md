# FFCR Automation – v30.0c (Final Success)

✅ **Status**: Fully functional  
🧪 **Validated Against**:
- Chrome v137
- MRNs: MM0000699461, MM0000333560
- Excel-driven input
- Visit PDF download with timestamped filenames
- Pagination logic (100 visits per page)
- Direct download links clicked (bypassing row clicking)

## 🔐 Key Milestones
- Fully extracted PDFs from **Patient Activity**
- Successfully handled multiple visits across multiple patients
- Detected and bypassed Edge-intercepted download traps
- Manual Allow Downloads workaround verified (screenshot logged)

## 🧩 Files in Bundle
- `run_ffcr_modmed_v30_0c.py`
- `launch_ffcr_v30_0c.bat`
- `mrn_input.xlsx`
- `manifest.txt`
- All resulting visit PDFs in `visit_activity/`

## 🧠 Notes
- Script will fail if multiple downloads are not allowed via Chrome prompt.
- Future versions will auto-configure Chrome via batch flags to bypass this.
- Bundle is preserved in GitHub and should be cloned before testing future variants.
