# FFCR ModMed Extractor – TRIBBY PATIENCE PATCH (V10.2k)

🚀 **First Confirmed Patient Activity PDF Extractor for ModMed**

This version, `run_ffcr_modmed_v10_2k_TRIBBY_PATIENCE_PATCH_v137.py`, represents the earliest validated FFCR extractor that successfully:

- Navigates to the **Patient Activity tab**
- Resolves direct download links for **visit PDFs**
- Attempts authenticated PDF downloads using `requests.get()`

---

## 🧠 Historical Significance

This script was validated through multiple runlogs dated **June 1, 2025**, for **MRN 1595525**:

- ✅ Log-confirmed navigation and tab detection
- ✅ PDF download links resolved and captured
- ✅ Files named by visit date: `1595525_Jul-18-2024.pdf`, `1595525_Sep-16-2024.pdf`
- ⛔ Some downloaded files redirected to login splash pages — indicating a need for browser-based download vs. `requests`

Despite this, **no other script prior to V10.2k** was confirmed to reach this depth within the Patient Activity extraction workflow.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- Python `3.13`
- ChromeDriver `v137` (GUI mode)
- Selenium `4.x`
- Direct PDF requests with `requests`
